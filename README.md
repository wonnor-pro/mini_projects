# Connor's Playground

This is where Connor mess around with some mini projects. These projects are normally very short and using Pygame to demonstrate.

Here is the list of current mini-projects:
- **Sudoku cracker** (backtrack algorithm)

  Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. (Wikipedia)

- **N Queens Puzzle** (local search)
  
  Originally known as Eight queens Puzzle. The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.
